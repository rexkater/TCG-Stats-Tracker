# TCG-Stats-Tracker
A data-gathering application where a user can maintain multiple "projects". Each project tracks competitive trading card game (TCG) results with the user entering matchup names and scores. The app should compute statistics like overall win rate, matchup win rates, and first-vs second (draw/play) win rates.
